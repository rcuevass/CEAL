# Data split

This script will split the original dataset into train and test.

Upon download, unzipped data needs to be under folder `caltech256`. 

After execution of the script, 20% of the data will be used as test and
the remaining 80% will be test. Note that the original data folder
`256_ObjectCategories` will not be available anymore

For execution: `bash divide_data.sh`
